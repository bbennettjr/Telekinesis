# Telekinesis
Meditation app to explore the metaphysical connection between mind and machine

Based on the idea of work done at Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR), Telekinesis approaches the mind's ability to interact with circuitry and the potential for connections outside of our daily experience.  

The concept is simple: focus your attention on controlling the random events occuring on screen.  This is the proverbial child bending the spoon, but in real life.  As the center object moves about randomly on the screen and its color changes, you can focus on moving it toward a specific location (a corner for example) or changing the color to black or white.  Behind the scenes statistical evidence is recorded and fed back to you.  

If the human mind is more powerful than we imagined, the scale of mobile technology can help uncover its ability.
